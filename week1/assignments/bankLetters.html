        // another way we could possible execute this loop in a more efficient way with out having to create and reparse new ( div ) dom nodes and keep re creating new nodes for every item from the array being looped. This happens since for each condition for each item in the array
        // we are actually creating new item node and re parsing whole html with (.innerHTML).
        // we could approach this a even more efficient way. in terms of code we could come in for our FOR LOOP by CREATING a new div that we manipulate WITHIN the loop to after then append all iterated items with their inloop created div to the doms already existing html div,
        // and reparse all changes all at once instad of one by one

        // letterDiv = document.querySelector('#letterDiv')
        // for(i=0; i < customers.length; i++) {
        //     newDiv = document.createElement('div');
        //     // newDiv.className ='letter' // this has been commented out, there is a extra space that pops out at the bottom figure it out why.
        //     if (customers[i].balance < 0) {

        // now we you insist in using the innerHTML there is a better performance wise manner
